Covid19 Analysis Report: Present within the Github repo as a pdf file.


Covid19 Analysis Presentation: Available as an mp4 file within the Github Repo. Can be viewed by downloading and viewing the file.

Assignment Activity 2 Observations:

a.	The number of cases amount 7582. However, the total number of rows within the dataframe amount to 7584. Hence, there are some rows containing null values.
b.	 Noted that the dataframe had a default index. 
c.	We can identify that the average number of deaths greatly exceeds the number of recoveries and hospitalisations. The average number of recoveries is very low when comparing to the total number of cases and deaths.
d.	We are unable to view the number of vaccinations over time with the data provided.
e.	We can identify that the missing values are from the row 875 and 876 of the Dataframe. The missing values are from the Bermuda Province of the date 2020-09-21 and 2020-09-22.
f.	In comparison to the Country wide averages, the number of deaths is lower than number of recoveries and hospitalisations. It is also extremely low in comparison to the national average. The mean number of cases in Gibraltar is also much lower in comparison to the national average.



Assignment Activity 3 Observations:

a.	The Province of Gibraltar has the highest number of individuals who have received a first dose but not a second dose with 264745 individuals.
b.	Noted that the province of Turks and Caicos Islands have the highest percent of individuals who have received a first dose but not a second dose with a percentage of 2.30709%.
c.	The number of vaccinated individuals had been rising till May 2021 when it reached its highest after which there has been a continuous decrease in the number of vaccinated individuals. 
d.	The number of individuals who received the first dose was highest during February 2021 post which there has been decrease in the number of first dose vaccinations which increases only in the months of May and July, 2021.
e.	The number of individuals who received the second dose had been rising till it reached its highest during May 2021 post which there has been decrease in the number of second dose vaccinations.




Assignment Activity 4 Observations: 

a.	There seems to be trend with the number of deaths, hospitalisations, and recoveries. The data in terms of monthly deaths for the province ‘Others’ was too large and skewed the lineplot generated. Hence, the same was excluded from the visualisation depicting monthly deaths across regions.
b.	On converting the data from date to month, we noted that there was a more standardised chart which was more neat and easier to understand.
c.	Death rates were highest in the provinces of Gibraltar and the Channel Islands. The death rates seemed to hit its peak during the months of August and September. The death rates dropped extremely quickly from September to October.
d.	There is a trend with the number of cases, deaths, hospitalisations, and recoveries. As the number of cases rose around January, those individuals having covid19 either died, were hospitalised, or recovered. Hence, there is a trend between these visualisations.
e.	Channel Islands had the most recoveries. The number of recoveries seems to be consistent most of the time. However, there were 2 periods of time during which Channel Islands had the second most recoveries.
f.	The visualisations seem to be of a good quality. However, there are some places it could be improved with a different colour scheme for most clarity.
g.	The visualisation will help the government with understanding the efficacy of the vaccinations over time and which regions to focus on to convince citizens of the vaccine efficacy.


Assignment Activity 5 Observations:

Noted that there was a null row within the twitter dataframe which was filtered before analysis.

The text column within the twitter dataframe consists of tweets for our analysis. On extraction and viewing of the hashtags within the twitter data, we can see that the largest number of hashtags contain #COVID19. On observation of the top 10 hashtags within our twitter data, we can see that 8 out of the top 10 tweets were about the COVID19 pandemic. 

We were able to identify those tweets containing the keywords “Covid”, “covid”, “corona” and “COVID”. We were able to identify 3154 unique tweets containing these keywords and were able to print those specific tweets along with the index for easy identification.

We were also able to identify tweets containing the keywords “#coronavirus” and “#vaccinated”. We were able to identify a total of 217 tweets containing “#coronavirus” and a total of 9 tweets containing “#vaccinated”. However, there were no tweets that contained both the hash tags “#coronavirus” and “#vaccinated”.
